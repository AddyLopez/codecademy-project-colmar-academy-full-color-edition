# Colmar Academy Full-Color Edition

**NOTE**: Here is a separately hosted version of codecademy-project-colmar-academy in full color. The purpose of this version is to showcase design decisions that diverge from the original version's 'pixel perfect' reproduction of the client's wireframes.

## Description

Student project for Codecademy.

**_Learning objective_**: To create the home page for a new school, called Colmar Academy, making use of the wireframes and media assets (e.g. video, images, icons) provided. The result of the original project was a disciplined, "pixel-perfect" reproduction of the wireframes without additional color or typographical embellishments. _Here, the project's design has been updated to include informed decisions about color, typography, and subtle effects to improve the UI._

## Additional Features of This Full-Color Edition

- Advanced CSS techniques, including CSS variables, transform, and color transition effects

- Analogous color scheme that develops the fictional Colmar Academy brand. The colors lend support to an aesthetic experience of dependability, consistency, seriousness, and legitimacy--all, qualities a prospective student would expect of a school. Subtle accents of color when hovering the mouse over certain elements add interactivity to the UI and help to prevent the aesthetic consistency from appearing austere, which would be off-putting to otherwise interested students.

- Selective use of white backgrounds for the most prominent, important content, as the eye is naturally drawn to the brightest areas of the screen with the greatest contrast.

- Informed typographical decisions. The chosen font, from the Google Fonts library, further develops the fictional Colmar Academy brand. As a sans-serif font, it conveys a modern sensibility, whereas a serif font would have conveyed a more traditional look at odds with my interpretation of the brand as a forward-thinking academy with technological, computer-centered course offerings. The font's combination of round characters with some edgy details adds a touch of flair and sophistication appropriate to a brand that offers courses in computer art and design. A half-pixel of added letter-spacing improves legibility and pushes the aesthetic closer toward a monospaced typeface, suggesting its technical associations but without sacrificing refinement.

- Use of Adobe Color's color wheel and accessibility tools, along with Google Chrome's DevTools, to ensure sufficient contrast ratios on par with the standard Web Content Accessibility Guidelines.

- Alterations to the code generating the client's black SVG icons in the mobile-display navbar, outlining the icons in white to improve their visibility against the brand's main color.

- Minor translation of the button's position in the banner to lend a subtle skeuomorphic effect to its flat design. That means that when the user clicks the flat button, it will feel as if the button is being pressed down like a real button.

## Features of the Original Project

- Semantic HTML (conscientiously coded with accessibility concerns, SEO, legibility, and maintainability in mind)

- Responsive CSS (including responsive navigation and techniques such as flexbox, grid, CSS functions, and media queries, with content visibility selectively hidden based on the wireframes)

- Follows wireframes for desktop and mobile display and includes client's media assets, thereby simulating a professional collaboration with a UX/UI designer

- Accessibility rating by Lighthouse audit: 100/100 for desktop, 97/100 for mobile devices

- Coded in VS Code using professional development workflow tools such as Live Server, GitHub Desktop, and GitHub Pages
